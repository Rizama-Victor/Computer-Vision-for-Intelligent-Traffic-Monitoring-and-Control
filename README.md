## 🧭 Overview
Conventional traffic systems struggle to adapt to changing road conditions which continues to be a major issue due to the rising number of vehicles causing congestion and longer travel times amongst other limitations of the current traffic control systems. This project focuses on the development of an Intelligent Traffic Light Management System that uses computer vision to adjust signal timings in real time based on actual traffic density in a bid to reduce wait times and improve the overall traffic flow efficiency.
