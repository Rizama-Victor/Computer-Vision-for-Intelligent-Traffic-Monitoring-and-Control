## 🧭 Overview
Conventional traffic systems struggle to adapt to changing road conditions which continues to be a major issue due to the rising number of vehicles causing congestion and longer travel times amongst other limitations of the current traffic control systems. This project focuses on the development of an Intelligent Traffic Light Management System that uses computer vision to adjust signal timings in real time based on actual traffic density in a bid to reduce wait times and improve the overall traffic flow efficiency.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

-  To develop a computer vision model capable of accurately detecting and classifying vehicles across multiple traffic lanes in real-time.
-  To count the number of vehicles in each lane based on the real-time detection results.
-  To dynamically adjust signal timing by assigning shorter waiting periods and longer green light durations to lanes with higher traffic density.
